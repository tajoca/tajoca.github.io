# Capture Input From User And Add Input Contents To A Row In A Table

Your task is to complete the logic of the function `addRow()` inside the file `addrow.js`.

When completed, `addRow()` will add a row into the __Receipt__ table with the entries the user has entered in the form for _Qty_, _Description_, and _Cost_. See the files `addRowToTable.mov` and `index.html`.

---

## The Only Rule

- You may only add code to the designated section of the `addRow()` function in the file `addrow.js`.

---

## The Only Tip

- You’ll need the following methods, which we discussed in class yesterday and today and of which you have examples:

       - `getElementsByTagName`

       - `createElement`

       - `createTextNode`

       - `appendChild`
